* Money Exchange Hub application

** Run using Docker

#+begin_src sh
  docker-compose up
#+end_src

You should then be able to open your browser on http://localhost:8000 and see a
page with links to sign in or sign up.


** Run Locally

Assuming you use virtualenv, follow these steps to download and run the application in this directory:

#+begin_src sh
  git clone git@github.com:uzbeki/exchange_hub.git
  virtualenv venv
  . venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

Now we need to create the database tables and an admin user.
Run the following and when prompted to create a superuser choose yes and
follow the instructions:

#+begin_src sh
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py createsuperuser
#+end_src


Finally, run the Django development server:

#+begin_src sh
  python manage.py runserver
#+end_src

You should then be able to open your browser on http://localhost:8000 and see a
page with links to sign in or sign up.
